		<p>ICEWS provides public data dating back to the mid-20th Century. Historical data is already compiled into yearly 
		datasets that can be downloaded and analyzed individually. ICEWS does not provide the entire repository as a single 
		download as there are many millions of records. Up until 2018, ICEWS released data packaged by year, but as the data
		streams bagan to increase and the volume of media reporting being acquired reach abundant levels, ICEWS began providing
		daily data releases. In order to analyze this data for the desired time frame, a large effort of data mining and cleansing
		had to be conducted. Using Python programming language, the data was collected, compiled, manipulated and exported to extract
		particular insights from the many features within the ICEWS dataset.

		<center><h2>Concept</h2></center>
		<p>The objective of this project is to collect, subset, manipulate and explore the extremely extensive collection 
		of data records in the ICEWS database. For the purpose of this analysis, a focus will be placed on events dating 
		from 2012 to as current as June 2019. Further, the data will be compiled to reflect events in which the United States 
		was the main actor in the report. By looking at the United States global media reporting from 2012-2019, a stronger 
		understanding can be developed across two presidencies and a dense history of world events. This visual presentation 
		will help display the capability that ICEWS provides in analyzing the global media at any scale.</p>
