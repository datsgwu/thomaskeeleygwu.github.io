		<p>The ICEWS dataset is an extremely complex collection of global interactions through source reporting and sentiment analysis. 
		The sheer volume of the data is partly what makes this data so complex, but it is also the implied ability to quantitatively 
		analyze the data to reveal hidden insights in events that were before unknown. The creation of visualizations for this project 
		will likely lead to further understanding of trends and will lend to a greater curiosity. This project aims to break down the 
		extensive data to display the capability to drill down on subsets of interest for any level of analysis. By focusing on the 
		United States over a conflicting time period, the worldly implications of shared events can be revealed and displayed to produce 
		actionable intelligence at any level. </p>

		<center><h1>Key Findings</h1></center>
		<center><li><h2>ICEWS is an incredibly abundant resources for studying global interactions and events </h2></li></center>
		<center><li><h2>With a broad approach and unspecified target, an extensive data mining process is required </h2></li></center>
		<center><li><h2>There are many reports in recent years involving the United States and other countries such as Russia and India </h2></li></center>
		<center><li><h2>A significant low period in sentiment with the United States is apparent and April 2017</h2></li></center>
		<center><li><h2>Further analysis of the about curiosity shows many adverse events happening in Syria and the middle east</h2></li></center>
		<center><li><h2>Geography plays a huge part in this data and can be visualized in extensive ways using Kepler</h2></li></center>
		<center><li><h2>There is a clear polarizing effect between left and right reporting of events over time</h2></li></center>
